# Influence Failure Probability (IFP)

## Purpose

The Influence Failure Probability (IFP) is a synthesized risk indicator
estimating the likelihood that a state will experience a **sharp,
nonlinear loss of global influence** within an approximate 10–20 year
horizon.

IFP is not a prediction of collapse.
It is an **early-warning probability** conditioned on structural stress,
unique leverage fragility, and trend acceleration.

## Core Inputs

IFP is derived from the interaction of:

- **UFIʳ** — current level of unique fragility
- **ΔUFI** — rate of fragility increase
- **ULIʳ** — magnitude of overperformance
- **Redundancy of Leverage (RoL)** — shock survivability
- **Shock Absorption Capacity (SAC)**
- **External Substitutability Index (ESI)**
- **Temporal Mismatch Risk (TMR)**

BIS acts as a constraint but does not directly drive IFP.

---

## Conceptual Logic

IFP rises fastest when:

1. Fragility is already high **and rising**
2. Influence depends on non-redundant leverage
3. External routing around the state is easy
4. Institutions lag reality
5. Shock recovery is weak

High structural power can **delay** failure,
but cannot eliminate it.

## Scoring Philosophy

- IFP is expressed as a **percentage (0–100%)**
- Designed for **comparative and directional** use
- Not intended for precise timing
- Most useful for identifying inflection risk

## Interpretation Guide

- **0–20%** → Stable influence
- **20–40%** → Elevated long-term risk
- **40–60%** → Serious medium-term risk
- **60–80%** → High probability of sharp influence loss
- **80–100%** → Extreme risk; influence brittle

## Relationship Summary

- **BIS** explains how much influence exists
- **ULIʳ** explains why influence exceeds baseline
- **UFIʳ + ΔUFI** explain how influence can break
- **IFP** integrates all three into a single warning signal
