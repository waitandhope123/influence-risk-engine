# Refined Unique Leverage Index (ULIʳ)

## Purpose

The Refined Unique Leverage Index (ULIʳ) captures how much a country’s
actual world influence exceeds (or falls short of) what its structural
baseline (BIS) alone would predict.

ULIʳ represents **country-specific sources of leverage** that are not
purely material, and which often explain why some states punch above
their weight.

It answers the question:

> “What unique, non-structural factors allow this state to exert more
> influence than its baseline would suggest?”

## Core Leverage Dimensions

ULIʳ is built from the following components:

1. **Narrative Leverage (NL)**
   - Ability to project a compelling, exportable story
   - Ideological, cultural, or institutional appeal

2. **Elite Fungibility (EF)**
   - Replaceability of elites without loss of system function
   - Depth of technocratic and institutional bench

3. **Contradiction Tolerance (CT)**
   - Capacity to operate despite internal inconsistency or hypocrisy
   - Ability to act externally while sustaining internal tension

4. **Legibility & Administrative Depth (LAD)**
   - State capacity to measure, classify, and act on society at scale
   - Bureaucratic reach and informational clarity

5. **Peripheral Assimilation Rate (PAR)**
   - Speed at which outsiders, minorities, or new territories become
     functionally integrated into the system

6. **Time-Horizon Elasticity (THE)**
   - Ability to pursue long-term strategies despite short-term costs
   - Institutional patience and continuity

7. **Redundancy of Leverage (RoL)**
   - Number of independent pathways through which influence is generated
   - Degree to which leverage survives loss of a single pillar

8. **External Substitutability Index (ESI)**
   - How easily the world can route around this state
   - Centrality to finance, trade, security, or technology networks

## Scoring Philosophy

- Each component is scored on a 0–100 scale.
- ULIʳ is an aggregate, directional score.
- High ULIʳ increases influence but also **increases exposure** if leverage
  is non-redundant.
- ULIʳ does not imply stability or durability; fragility is handled by UFIʳ.

---

## What ULIʳ Is Not

- ULIʳ is not a moral score.
- ULIʳ does not measure popularity.
- ULIʳ does not guarantee long-term influence.

Overperformance without resilience often precedes sharp correction.

---

## Relationship to Other Indices

- **BIS** defines expected influence.
- **ULIʳ** defines unique leverage above baseline.
- **UFIʳ** defines the likelihood that leverage breaks.

ULIʳ must always be interpreted alongside UFIʳ.
