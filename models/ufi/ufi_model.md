# Refined Unique Fragility Index (UFIʳ)

## Purpose

The Refined Unique Fragility Index (UFIʳ) captures the likelihood that a
state’s influence will suffer a **rapid, nonlinear decline** due to
structural, institutional, or narrative failure.

UFIʳ does not measure weakness.
It measures **break risk**.

It answers the question:

> “If pressure increases or a shock occurs, how likely is it that this
> state’s influence fails suddenly rather than degrading gradually?”

## Core Fragility Dimensions

UFIʳ is composed of the following factors:

1. **Identity Rigidity (IR)**
   - Inability to adapt national identity narratives
   - Zero-sum internal identity conflicts

2. **Coordination Friction (CF)**
   - Institutional gridlock
   - High veto-player density
   - Center–periphery breakdowns

3. **Dependence Asymmetry (DA)**
   - Overreliance on narrow exports, routes, or patrons
   - Lack of diversification

4. **Shock Absorption Capacity (SAC)**
   - Ability to recover after crises
   - Institutional learning speed
   - Buffer capacity

5. **Elite–Mass Feedback Quality (EMF)**
   - Whether warning signals reach decision-makers
   - Ability to self-correct without repression or rupture

6. **Narrative Balance (NB)**
   - Ability to tolerate plural narratives without paralysis
   - Risk of narrative collapse or radicalization

7. **Temporal Mismatch Risk (TMR)**
   - Speed mismatch between institutions and reality
   - Lag between change (tech, demographic, geopolitical) and governance

## Scoring Philosophy

- Each fragility component is scored from 0–100.
- Higher scores indicate **greater fragility**.
- UFIʳ aggregates vulnerability, acceleration, and non-redundancy.
- Fragility often rises before influence visibly declines.

## What UFIʳ Is Not

- UFIʳ is not an index of poverty or underdevelopment.
- UFIʳ does not imply inevitable collapse.
- UFIʳ measures **risk**, not fate.

## Relationship to Other Indices

- **BIS** indicates structural capacity.
- **ULIʳ** indicates overperformance above baseline.
- **UFIʳ** indicates the probability that leverage breaks.

High BIS can mask high UFIʳ until a shock reveals it.
