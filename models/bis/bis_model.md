# Baseline Influence Score (BIS)

## Purpose

The Baseline Influence Score (BIS) represents the level of world influence
a country would be expected to have based purely on structural factors.

BIS intentionally excludes narrative, legitimacy, or fragility effects.
It answers the question:

> “Given its material and structural characteristics, how influential
> *should* this state be in the international system?”

BIS serves as the reference baseline against which overperformance
(ULIʳ) and failure risk (UFIʳ) are evaluated.

## Core Components

BIS is derived from five structural domains:

1. **Economic Scale (ES)**
   - GDP (nominal and PPP, blended)
   - Share of global output

2. **Population & Human Capital (PH)**
   - Total population
   - Working-age ratio
   - Education and health proxies (high level)

3. **Military Capacity & Projection (MP)**
   - Defense spending
   - Force projection capability
   - Strategic deterrence (binary/ordinal)

4. **Geography & Strategic Position (GS)**
   - Access to sea lanes
   - Chokepoints and trade routes
   - Strategic depth and borders

5. **Technology & Industrial Capacity (TI)**
   - R&D intensity
   - Advanced manufacturing
   - Control of critical technologies

## Scoring Philosophy

- Each component is normalized on a 0–100 scale.
- BIS is an aggregate score, not a prediction.
- No single component should dominate the score.
- BIS is deliberately conservative and slow-moving.

---

## What BIS Is Not

- BIS is **not** a measure of legitimacy or moral authority.
- BIS does **not** capture narrative appeal or institutional quality.
- BIS does **not** predict sudden influence loss.

Those effects are handled by ULIʳ and UFIʳ.

## Update Frequency

BIS should only be recalculated when:
- New structural data becomes available, or
- Major structural shocks occur (war, territorial change, demographic collapse).

Short-term political events should not materially affect BIS.
